        "the call stack and the variables in scope, and lets execution continue; " +
        "`op: \"snapshots\"` returns what was captured. Studio's debugger has to " +
        "decide whether to resume the instant it stops, and cannot wait for a " +
        "tool call to come back with an answer, so stepping through code line by " +
        "line is not possible this way — but 'what was this value when it got " +
        "here' is, which is usually the actual question.\n\n" +
        "`condition` is a Luau expression evaluated where the breakpoint sits, so " +
        "a breakpoint can fire only on the case that matters — `health < 0`, " +
        "`player.Name == \"someone\"`.\n\n" +
        "`logMessage` is ALSO a Luau expression, not a template string: its value " +
        'is printed when the breakpoint is hit, so write `"health=" .. health` ' +
        "rather than `health={health}`. Prose is a syntax error. Read the lines " +
        "back with `console`.\n\n" +
        "Two things about it are measured, not assumed, and both waste your time " +
        "otherwise. A breakpoint fires ONCE PER RUN, not once per pass: on a " +
        "five-iteration loop it printed a single line, for the first iteration " +
        "only. It is not a way to watch a value change inside a loop — to see " +
        "every pass, have the code itself print and read that with `console`. " +
        "And a log expression CANNOT SEE THE LOOP CONTROL VARIABLE: on " +
        "`for index = 1, 5 do`, a breakpoint in the body read the body's own " +
        "locals correctly and `index` as nil. Wrap values in `tostring` so a nil " +
        "prints as \"nil\" instead of throwing.\n\n" +
        "A log expression that throws is reported as \"Breakpoint ... ignored\" in " +
        "`console`, NOT here — `set` still returns Verified, because Studio only " +
        "compiles the expression once the line is reached.\n\n" +
        "So the two kinds cost different things: a `logMessage` breakpoint never " +
        "stops and gives you one line you composed in advance, while one without " +
        "it stops briefly and gives you the whole frame — every local and its " +
        "type, without having to guess beforehand which value would matter. Both " +
        "give you that for one pass only. Reach for the log when you know what " +
        "to watch, the capture when you do not.\n\n" +

        "and capture.\n\n" +

        "assignment above it went from silent to firing on every pass. If one " +
