/**
 * The gap between where a click was aimed and where the client read it.

 * Returned rather than corrected because it cannot be predicted. Measured
 * against a live playtest, sending (300,300):
 *
 *   Galaxy S25 Ultra, landscape  viewport 685x338  read at (253,242)
 *   iPhone 16, portrait          viewport 391x758  read at (300,183)
 *   no device emulated                             read at (300,242)
 *
 * A constant translation in every case, never a scale -- four points spanning
 * the viewport gave the same delta to the pixel. But the translation changes
 * with the device and the orientation, and fits no formula over resolution,
 * viewport and GUI inset that holds for both phones: the horizontal term is
 * (device - viewport) / 2 and the vertical term is not.
 *
 * An earlier version of this file claimed the error was the ratio between the
 * device resolution and the screenshot's, which is wrong, and wrong in a way
 * that happens to land close to correct in the middle of the screen where it
 * was first observed.
 *
 * Applying it automatically was tried and reverted. The translation is real
 * with nothing emulated -- (0,-58), which is exactly GuiService:GetGuiInset()
 * -- and on an iPhone 16 in portrait, measured equal at two points 215px apart.
 * On the SAME phone in LandscapeRight it is not a translation at all: the
 * horizontal term inverts and scales (seen.x fitted 919 - 1.4 * sent.x), so
 * subtracting the measured constant moved the aim from 187px out to 449px out.
 *
 * Nor can a better fit be sampled. Synthetic MOVES report no position --
 * InputChanged never fires for SendMousePosition -- so the map is observable
 * only by clicking, and probe clicks press whatever they land on. Aim once,
 * read the delta, correct.
