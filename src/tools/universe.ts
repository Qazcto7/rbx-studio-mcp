/**
 * Operating the published game, as opposed to building it.
 *
 * This is the one genuinely new tool in this area, and it earns the slot by
 * being a different job rather than a different spelling of an existing one.
 * Everything else that reaches Roblox folded into the tool that already owned
 * the noun: uploads and publishing into `assets`, live saves into `datastore`,
 * remote code into `execute_luau`, cloud scripts into `script_read`/`script_edit`.
 *
 * What was left over has no such home. Banning a player, messaging live servers
 * and rolling servers onto a new build are not things you do to a place file;
 * they are things you do to a running game with people in it. Bolting them onto
 * `character` or `console` would have meant hiding live moderation inside a tool
 * about the local test avatar.
 *
 * Everything here acts on real players. Every write asks for confirmation.
