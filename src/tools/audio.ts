        "Roblox's modern audio is a signal graph, not one instance with a Play " +
        "method. An `AudioPlayer` holds the asset, an `AudioEmitter` puts the " +
        "sound in the world or an `AudioDeviceOutput` sends it to the player's " +
        "speakers, effects sit in between, and NOTHING is connected until a " +
        "`Wire` joins two named pins. A place can hold a perfectly configured " +
        "AudioPlayer with the right asset and the right volume and be " +
        "completely silent, with no error anywhere, because the wire was never " +
        "made. That is what this tool is for: `create` can make each instance, " +
        "but the pin names, the direction and the choice of sink are where it " +
        "actually goes wrong.\n\n" +
        "`graph` is the one to reach for: it builds a whole working chain in " +
        "one undoable step. `kind=\"world\"` gives a sound that comes from a " +
        "part; `kind=\"ui\"` gives one with no position, for menus and music. " +
        "Add `effects` to splice reverb, EQ or a fader into the chain.\n\n" +
        "`wire` joins two instances you already have. `inspect` reads an " +
        "existing graph back and reports every connection — including the ones " +
        "that report Connected = false, which the Explorer does not show and " +
        "which are the usual reason for silence.\n\n" +
        "The old `Sound` instance still works and is still shorter for a plain " +
