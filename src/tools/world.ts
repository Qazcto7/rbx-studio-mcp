        "verified, whether the asset is free, and what Roblox thinks it is " +
        "(\"Door/Furniture\"). `insert` puts one into the place by id.\n\n" +
        "Results are ranked by approval WEIGHTED BY vote count, because the raw " +
        "percentage lies: 100% from two voters outranks 82% from five thousand " +
        "unless the count is taken into account. The vote count is shown beside " +
        "the percentage for the same reason.\n\n" +
        "Filters — `excludeScripts`, `maxTriangles`, `verifiedOnly`, `freeOnly`, " +
        "`minVotes` — are applied here, not by Roblox, and several pages are " +
        "fetched to fill the results. Roblox's own sort and creator filters are " +
        "accepted by the endpoint and silently ignored, so they are not offered.\n\n" +
        "ALWAYS check `hasScripts` before inserting. Free models carrying " +
        "scripts are the oldest hazard on the platform, and a model dropped into " +
        "someone's game can run whatever it likes. The insert reports the script " +
        "count again, and names them, so it can still be undone.\n\n" +
        "`peek` is the safer half of that: it loads the asset in memory WITHOUT " +
        "putting it in the place and tells you exactly what is inside — every " +
        "class, every script by name. Nothing is parented, so there is nothing " +
        "to undo. Use it whenever `hasScripts` says YES and the model still " +
        "looks worth having.\n\n" +
        "Audio searches take a different path from everything else here. They go " +
        "to the engine's own audio index, so results carry duration, artist and " +
        "whether the clip is music or a sound effect — the fields that actually " +
        "decide which sound you want. They return SOUND EFFECTS by default; pass " +
        '`audioType: "Music"` for tracks. Filter with `minDuration` / ' +
        "`maxDuration` — a footstep is under a second and a music bed is minutes.\n\n" +
        "Only public assets can be inserted. A private or deleted id fails with " +
        "a message saying so rather than inserting nothing quietly.\n\n" +
        "`bake` is unrelated to the Creator Store and does not upload anything. " +
        "It turns EditableMesh and EditableImage data into static content, which " +
        "frees the editable memory budget and lets a mesh built at runtime " +
        "replicate from the server down to clients.\n\n" +
        "READ THIS BEFORE REACHING FOR IT. What it produces is scoped to the data " +
        "model session it was made in. Baking in edit mode therefore carries " +
        "NOTHING into a playtest — a playtest is a new data model, and the " +
        "content reads as empty there. Measured, not assumed. Its real use is " +
        "against a RUNNING playtest server session: pass that `studioId`, and " +
        "baking a mesh the game just built is what lets clients see it.\n\n" +
        "It does not help `generate` at all. Generated meshes hold opaque " +
        "content, which the engine refuses to bake.\n\n" +
        "THE OTHER DIRECTION: `upload` sends a local file TO Roblox and " +
        "gives you the asset id. Audio, an image, a 3D model or a video, " +
        "picked by extension — .mp3/.ogg/.wav/.flac, .png/.jpg/.bmp/.tga, " +
        ".fbx/.gltf/.glb, .mp4/.mov. This closes the one hole nothing else " +
        "here covers: a sound effect sitting in a folder on disk used to " +
        "need Studio's import dialog before anything could reference it.\n\n" +
        "Uploads are moderated and count against a real monthly quota. Do not " +
        "guess what it is — Roblox's own guide and the live API disagree, and " +
        "the account's verification level changes it. Ask `op=\"quota\"`. Do " +
        "not upload speculatively, and do not re-upload to retry: the first " +
        "one probably worked.\n\n" +
        "`grant` gives a game or a person permission to use assets you own. " +
        "You do NOT need this for your own assets in your own game — those " +
        "always work. It is for a collaborator's place, or a group game you " +
        "do not own. A grant to a game is PERMANENT; Roblox provides no way " +
        "to revoke one, so it needs `confirm: true`.\n\n" +
        "`publish` sends a .rbxl or .rbxlx from disk to a place. It SAVES a " +
        "new version by default and only goes live with `confirm: true`. " +
        "Note a real limitation: Roblox's publishing API does not update " +
        "EditableImage, EditableMesh, PartOperation, SurfaceAppearance or " +
        "BaseWrap instances, and reports success anyway — publish from " +
        "Studio if the place uses any of those.\n\n" +
        "Publishing alone does NOT move anyone already playing — they stay " +
        "on their server running the old code until it empties. Pass " +
        "`restart: true` to roll live servers onto the new version, which " +
        "bleeds them off over 10 minutes rather than dropping players.\n\n" +
        "`quota` reports how many uploads are left before Roblox starts " +

        "before a batch rather than discovering the ceiling halfway through.\n\n" +
