 * What to tell the agent when this listing leaves no default target.

 * Two sessions on one placeId is an editor and its own playtest, and telling
 * the agent to go and ask the user which place they mean is a question with no
 * answer -- there is one place, in two states. `resolveSession` already knew
 * that and raised SAME_PLACE_STUDIO with real guidance, but this listing, which
 * is what an agent reads *before* it gets that far, gave the opposite advice.
 * Asking the user was the first thing it said, and the error it would hit next
 * says in as many words not to. Same wording in both places now.
