/**
 * MCP resources: place state an agent can read without spending a tool call.
 *
 * Tools cost schema tokens in every request, whether or not they are used.
 * Resources cost nothing until read, which makes them the right home for the
 * three questions asked at the start of almost every session — what is
 * connected, what is in the place, what is selected — and lets a client attach
 * them as context rather than making the model ask.
 *
 * Everything here is read-only by construction: resources have no parameters to
 * validate and no way to express a mutation, which is exactly why the state
 * queries belong here and the actions do not.
