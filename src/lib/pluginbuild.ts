/**
 * Fingerprint of the Luau sources this server package ships.

 * the file changes (under Wine it never does), so a developer who rebuilds the
 * plugin while working in a terminal keeps talking to the previous build — and the symptom is a handler quietly behaving like an older
 * version, which is miserable to debug. The plugin reports the fingerprint it
 * was built from, the server compares it against this one, and any mismatch is
 * surfaced in `studio_status` and `list_studios` with the fix.
 *
 * Must stay byte-identical to the hash in scripts/build-plugin.mjs.

 * Studio, reinstall — that cannot possibly help, because the plugin was already
 * the newer of the two. Re-hashing when a file's mtime moves costs a stat per
