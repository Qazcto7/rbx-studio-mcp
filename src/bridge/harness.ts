/**
 * Runs a coding agent next to the user, on the panel's behalf.
 *
 * The console panel has a prompt line, and free text typed into it is not a
 * command -- it is a request for an agent. MCP gives no way to deliver that to
 * the agent already attached to this bridge: a server answers clients, it never
 * calls them, so there is no inbound channel into a session someone is sitting
 * in. What there IS, on every machine that has one of these tools installed, is
 * a headless mode. So the bridge starts its own.
 *
 * The agent it starts connects back to this same bridge as an ordinary MCP
 * client -- the port is taken, so its server becomes a peer and proxies -- and
 * drives the same Studio the user is looking at. Its output is streamed into
 * the console log line by line, which is what makes the panel its face rather
 * than a black box with a spinner.
 *
 * Deliberately a registry rather than a `claude` integration. Users arrive with
 * whatever harness they already use, and every one of them ships the same three
 * things: a binary, a one-shot flag, and a way to ask for machine-readable
 * output. Adding one is a table entry, and a harness nobody wrote an adapter
 * for still works through `generic`, which simply prints what it prints.
