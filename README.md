# Roblox Studio MCP

Let an AI agent drive Roblox Studio: read your place, edit scripts, build geometry, run playtests, take screenshots. 35 tools. MIT.

## Install

**1. The plugin**

```bash
npx -y @el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp --install-plugin
```

Or drop `StudioMCP.rbxmx` from [Releases](https://github.com/EL4CTEO/rbx-studio-mcp/releases) into your Studio plugins folder.

After installing or updating the plugin, **quit Studio completely and start it again** — focusing the window does not reload a plugin.

<details>
<summary>Linux (Vinegar / Wine)</summary>

`--install-plugin` looks for Studio's plugins folder in every Vinegar prefix (`~/.local/share/vinegar/prefixes/*` and the Flatpak one under `~/.var/app/org.vinegarhq.Vinegar`), `$WINEPREFIX` and `~/.wine`, and installs into each one it finds, because Studio may be running from either. Where a prefix's registry moves `Local AppData` elsewhere (Vinegar does this for the prefixes it creates: `~/.local/share/vinegar/appdata`), that folder is used instead of the one inside the prefix. To use some other folder:

```bash
STUDIO_MCP_PLUGINS_DIR=/path/to/AppData/Local/Roblox/Plugins npx -y @el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp --install-plugin
```

`npx -y @el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp doctor` lists each plugins folder and whether its copy matches this package. Under Wine, `playtest op="multiplayer"` is refused by default, `play`/`stop` can take 30–90s to settle, and Studio can stop answering for a few minutes at a time — poll `playtest op="state"` instead of retrying.

**2. The server**

```bash
claude mcp add roblox-studio -- npx -y @el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp
```

<details>
<summary>Other clients</summary>

Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add roblox-studio -- npx -y @el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp
```

Cursor, Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Windsurf — add to their config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roblox-studio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

VS Code / Copilot (`.vscode/mcp.json`) uses `"servers"` instead of `"mcpServers"`, plus `"type": "stdio"`.

opencode (`opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "roblox-studio": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

**3.** Open Studio and accept the `127.0.0.1` prompt. Check it works with `studio_status`.

Something wrong? Run `npx -y @el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp doctor` — it says what is broken and how to fix it.

Port is **44755**, loopback only. Change it with `--port` and match it in the plugin.

## Tools

| | |
|---|---|
| **Session** | `studio_status` `list_studios` `set_active_studio` |
| **Discover** | `tree` `inspect` `find` `api` |
| **Scripts** | `script_read` `script_edit` `script_grep` `script_create` |
| **Instances** | `create` `modify` `delete` `move` |
| **World** | `geometry` `terrain` `generate` `assets` `collision` `audio` `animation` `undo` |
| **Data & live game** | `datastore` `universe` |
| **Run & debug** | `playtest` `execute_luau` `character` `input` `console` `debug` `performance` |
| **Look** | `screenshot` `viewport` `device` |

Write tools take arrays — ten script edits is one call, one **Ctrl+Z**, and all-or-nothing.

## Open Cloud

Some calls reach past Studio to Roblox itself. All need one API key; everything else works without it.

| | |
|---|---|
| `assets op="upload"` | send a local audio/image/model/video file, get an asset id |
| `datastore target="live"` | the running game's real player data |
| `execute_luau target="live"` | run a script on the published place |
| `universe` | restart servers, message them, ban players |
| also | `assets op="grant"`, `op="publish"`, `script_read`/`script_edit target="live"` |

Make a key at [Creator Dashboard → Credentials](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials), adding the permissions you want: `assets`, `universe-datastores`, `ordered-data-stores`, `luau-execution-sessions`, `universe-places`, `universe-place-instances`, `universe`, `messaging-service`, `user-restrictions`, `inventory`, `users`, `asset-permissions`.

Then in the Studio panel:

```
cloud key <paste>
cloud user <your user id>
cloud place <place id>
```

`cloud place` works out the universe for you. The typed key is masked in the log and in the history, and stored at `~/.rbx-studio-mcp/credentials.json` (mode 0600) — never in the place file, never in the conversation. `cloud` shows what is set, `cloud test` re-checks it, `cloud forget` deletes it. `ROBLOX_API_KEY` and friends in the environment work too and take priority.

Two things to watch: a playtest connects a second session, so pass `studioId` and use the edit one for changes that must last; `device` emulation stays on until `device op="stop"`.

## The console panel

Every call is logged with how long it took. At the foot of the panel is a command line — type a command, or type a sentence and a coding agent answers it.

| | |
|---|---|
| `help` | list everything |
| `doctor` | check the setup |
| `status` `version` `place` `clients` | what this session is |
| `studios` `use <n>` | which Studio window calls go to |
| `theme [name]` `visuals` `autoopen [on\|off]` `log [level]` `clear` `copy` | the panel |
| `port [n]` `reconnect` | the connection |
| `cloud [key\|user\|group\|test\|forget]` | the Open Cloud key `upload` uses |
| `agent [use <id>\|new]` `stop` | which agent runs your prompts |
| anything else | sent to that agent |

Click the bar and every command is listed with what it does. Keep typing to filter, scroll for the rest, click one to fill it in.

**Prompts start a real agent** — whichever you have on PATH: Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Gemini, Cursor, Amp, Qwen Code, Factory Droid, goose, Copilot CLI, Aider, Crush, DeepSeek Harness. It runs headless, drives the same Studio, and its work appears in the log. It is a separate session from your terminal, billed separately, and allowed the `rbx-studio` tools only. `stop` cancels it.

Eight themes behind the tab on the right edge. Your pick is remembered.

## Why this one

- **Push, not poll** — 13.6 ms per call against 25.8 ms.
- **Safe script edits** — writes go through the script editor, so unsaved work survives.
- **Stale edits are refused** — pass back the `rev` from `script_read` and a write lands only if nobody else touched the file.
- **Property names are checked** against the running engine, so `Anchorred` comes back as a suggestion, not a runtime error.

## DeepSeek Harness (dsh)

This server registers as a dsh plugin. Append this row to `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`,
or to `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>/cordis.patch.yml` for one profile only:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: mcp-rbx-studio
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
      config:
        serverName: rbx-studio
        transport: stdio
        command: npx
        args: ['-y', '@el4cteo/rbx-studio-mcp']
        cwd: !!js process.cwd()
```

Then `dsh --profile headless "what is in workspace"`. Needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
The same row, commented, is in `config/dsh.cordis.yml` for use with `dsh --patch`.

## Security

Loopback only, and requires a header a browser cannot set cross-origin. Your experience's "Allow HTTP Requests" setting is untouched.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # TypeScript -> dist/
npm run install:plugin # build the plugin and copy it into Studio
npm test
```

Needs `luau`, `luau-compile` and `luau-analyze` from [the Luau releases](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/releases) on `PATH` or in `tools/`.
