/**
 * Compiles every plugin source file, so a broken one is caught here rather than
 * in Studio.
 *
 * This exists because the feedback loop without it is terrible. Nothing in the
 * Node build reads the Luau at all -- `build:plugin` packs the files into an
 * .rbxmx as text -- so a syntax error ships, installs, and is only discovered
 * when the user focuses Studio and the plugin fails to load. It cost two
 * sessions in one afternoon: a literal newline written into a string where an
 * escape was meant, and a closure that captured a nil global because it sat
 * above the forward declaration of the local it meant to call. The first is a
 * compile error and would have been caught instantly by this. The second is not,
 * which is why `--!strict` analysis runs too when the analyser is available:
 * an unknown global is exactly what it flags.
 *
 * Needs `luau-compile` (and ideally `luau-analyze`) on PATH, in ./tools, or
 * named by the LUAU_COMPILE / LUAU_ANALYZE environment variables. Get them from
 * https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/releases.
 *
 * Silent and exit 0 when everything compiles; prints what failed otherwise.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-plugin.mjs

 * Roblox's type definitions also reports every engine global as unknown, so

/*
 * Diagnostics about a table this file declares its own type for.
 *
 * The LocalShadow filter was the only thing let through, and that let a whole
 * class of error ship: a field read or written on a `--!strict` table type that
 * does not declare it. The plugin failed to load on the first line it logged --
 * "attempt to perform arithmetic on nil" -- because a batch of edits added five
 * uses of `state.entries` and the edit declaring it never landed. The analyser
 * had said so, four times, and this script threw it away.
 *
 * These two patterns are safe to surface where the rest is not. Without Roblox
 * type definitions the analyser cannot know what `Instance` or `Color3` are, so
 * it reports engine globals in their hundreds -- but those come out as unknown
 * *globals* and unknown *types*. A key missing from a named table type can only
 * be a table this file declared itself.

/*
 * Globals Roblox provides, so the analyser (which has no definitions file here)
 * reports them as unknown and they can be told apart from a name that is simply
 * not declared.
 *
 * That difference is the point. The `LocalShadow` check above only catches a
 * local declared LATER in the file. A name that is never declared anywhere
 * (`settle` read inside a handler where the `local settle` was never written,
 * `unloading` guarded in a function that never had it) is not shadowed by
 * anything: at runtime it is a nil global, the guard is silently false, and the
 * first time the line runs it fails with "attempt to perform arithmetic on nil"
 * or does nothing at all. Both of those shipped, in a file the tests did not
 * exercise, and both were "Unknown global" in the analyser's output the whole
 * time -- buried under the hundreds of `Color3` and `UDim2` lines that made the
 * filter ignore the message entirely.
 *
 * Anything not in this list is reported. If a real engine global trips it, add it
 * here; that costs one line, and the alternative cost a broken release.
