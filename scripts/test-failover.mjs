/**
 * Checks that the bridge port outlives the process that happened to bind it.
 *
 * Exactly one process can hold the port the Studio plugin dials; every other
 * MCP client that starts this server proxies through it. The bug this covers is
 * what used to happen when the holder exited: the peers kept posting to a socket
 * nobody was listening on, so every tool call failed and the plugin's console
 * sat on "Nothing is listening on port 44755" -- with a healthy server process
 * still running that could have taken over. Reported by a user whose agent said
 * it was connected while the console showed the opposite.
 *
 * Runs against real sockets on a spare loopback port, because the thing being
 * tested is the bind race itself and a fake would test the fake.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/test-failover.mjs
